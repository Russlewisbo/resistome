## Welcome

This website presents a comprehensive genomic and phenotypic analysis of 42 bacterial isolates from the KPC-31 resistome project. The collection includes carbapenemase-producing *Klebsiella pneumoniae* and *Escherichia coli* isolates with detailed molecular characterization.

::: {.callout-important}
## Critical Finding

**ALL 42 isolates (100%) carry the blaKPC-31 carbapenemase gene**, making this a KPC-31-specific collection with significant clinical and epidemiological implications.

## Highlights

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Species Distribution

*Klebsiella pneumoniae* dominates the collection (78.6%, n=33), with *E. coli* variants comprising 21.4%.

### High-Risk Clones

Five high-risk sequence types identified:
- **ST307** (n=16): Global high-risk clone with heterogeneous resistance
- **ST512** (n=5): IncX3 plasmid-associated, 100% CAZ-AVI resistant
- **ST101** (n=7): armA-mediated pan-aminoglycoside resistance
- **ST147** (n=2): IncF plasmids with high HGT potential
- **ST131** (n=2): E. coli pandemic clone

### Plasmid Findings

- **IncF plasmids** spreading across 4 different sequence types
- **IncX3** fixed in ST512 (100% prevalence)
- **62%** of isolates have no detectable Inc groups (chromosomal integration?)

### Clinical Impact

Limited treatment options due to:
- Universal blaKPC-31 carriage
- Variable CAZ-AVI resistance (35.7% high-level)
- Multiple resistance mechanisms per isolate
- Active horizontal gene transfer

## Key Visualizations

The full report contains interactive visualizations showing:

- Species and sequence type distributions
- CAZ-AVI resistance patterns by clone
- Multi-antibiotic resistance heatmaps
- Resistance gene profiles
- Plasmid incompatibility group networks
- Integrated analysis of plasmids, genes, and phenotypes

## Study Significance

This analysis reveals:

1. **Universal blaKPC-31 dissemination** across multiple high-risk clones
2. **Perfect KL-ST associations** indicating stable clonal lineages
3. **Clone-specific resistance mechanisms** (plasmid-based vs chromosomal)
4. **Active horizontal gene transfer** of IncF plasmids within *K. pneumoniae*
5. **Urgent need for infection control** measures

## Public Health Concern

The combination of high-risk global clones (ST307, ST512, ST101, ST131, ST147) with active plasmid dissemination represents a significant public health threat requiring immediate intervention.
